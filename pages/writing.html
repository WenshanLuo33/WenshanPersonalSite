          <p>Reflection, Distance, and Light</p>

          <p>The city often stages its own illusions. Glass facades reflect what lies beyond them, transforming distance into proximity, but only for a moment. These reflections, polished and perfect, offer an image of the world as it could be: fragmented, flattened, yet luminous. They promise connection while standing as barriers, walls that both reveal and obscure. The skyline becomes a performance, its actors perfectly rehearsed yet forever out of reach.
            
            What is closer? The reflection of a distant skyline or the real one just beyond? In seeking clarity, do we find ourselves more attached to the idealized version, shimmering and untouchable, than to the messy, unpolished original? These surfaces, with their carefully engineered distortions, draw us in even as they hold us back.
            
            Light, too, conspires in this act. Reflections brighten spaces that natural light was never meant to touch, assigning southern warmth to northern-facing rooms. Yet this generosity is not without cost. As the sun grows too bright, piercing rather than softening, do these spaces still crave their borrowed light? The act of giving, however generous, always bears its limits.
            
            And so, we stand before this interplay of light and shadow, reflection and reality, proximity and separation. The city, in its infinite surfaces, invites us to question not only what we see, but how we see—and how much of what we think we know is just a trick of the light.</p>

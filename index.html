        <p>Hi! I'm Wenshan Luo.</p>
        <p>
          I am a student in the MSAUD program at Cornell University. I completed my five-year undergraduate architecture program at Wuhan University in China. I have a strong interest in architecture, urban design, and theory, and I am currently exploring my own style and research methodology.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have interned at Beijing Institute of Architectural Design (BIAD) and OPEN Architecture.

          <p class="project-title">A home designed for mobile workers for a while.</p>
          <p class="project-description">
            As Yangzhou expands, demolition creates recyclable bricks. Brickmen collect and repurpose them, aided by a mobile, balloon-based structure. They live, work, and sort bricks for sale or reuse, moving to the next site once finished. The design is flexible, sustainable, and innovative.

          <p class="project-description">
            Dazhimen railway station in Wuhan’s Hankou district, once abandoned, is now an urban oasis where nature intertwines with history. Vines and greenery reclaim the ruins, creating a balance between past and present. This transformation highlights the city’s evolving relationship with nature amid urban growth.

            The project in Glasgow’s Yorkhill area examines student enclaves and their impact on local communities. It proposes a network of public spaces, improved streets, and green corridors to enhance student-local interactions. Centralizing student housing aims to create a more inclusive and sustainable community.
